## 🎯 Project Goal

The main goal of this project was to develop a **single-page application** that allows users to search for books by category using the **Open Library API**. The focus was on creating a responsive and dynamic user interface, handling the display of results and book details robustly.

The core development focused on **DOM (Document Object Model) manipulation** using **JavaScript**, and integrating an external API to fetch real-time data. I also paid attention to a responsive and intuitive design, managing the grid layout of the cards precisely and using LESS to keep the CSS code organized and modular.

## ✨ Implemented Features

* **Intuitive Book Search:** Quickly find books by category.
* **Detailed Result Display:** Books are shown in a dynamic grid layout: **3 columns on desktop/tablet** and **2 columns on mobile devices**, ensuring optimal viewing on any screen.
* **Book Details in Modal:** Clicking a card opens a modal with the book description, author(s), and title.
* **Robust Data Validation:** Use of `lodash.get` to safely access data from the API, preventing errors and ensuring application stability.
* **"Clear" Functionality:** A button to easily reset the search field and results.
* **Loading/Error Indicators:** Visual feedback to the user during search or if issues arise.
* **Responsive and Adaptive Design:** The interface adapts fluidly to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile), with optimized breakpoints for a consistent user experience.
* **Modern and Modular Style:** A clean, modern look, built with LESS for efficient and maintainable CSS code.
* **Webpack Configuration:** Webpack is used for bundling, asset management (CSS, images, fonts), and project optimization, ensuring an efficient and performant build process.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** Semantic page structure.
* **CSS3 / LESS:** For styling and organizing CSS code with variables and mixins.
* **JavaScript (Vanilla):** All interactive logic, DOM manipulation, and API calls.
* **Open Library API:** The data source for book searches.
* **Webpack:** JavaScript bundler and asset manager, set up to compile LESS, process images and fonts, and optimize the project.
* **Lodash.get:** Lightweight library used for safely accessing nested object properties, with fallback handling.
* **Google Fonts:** `Inter` for body text and `Style Script` for a distinctive app title look.

## 🚀 How to Run the Project Locally

Follow these steps to clone the repository and run the project on your computer:

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sadsotti/owly-book-search.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd owly-book-search
    ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

    Make sure you have [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed. Then run:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. **Start the development server:**

    This command will start a local development server with Webpack, compile your code, and automatically open the app in the browser.
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

5. **(Optional) Create the production build:**

    To generate optimized files for production (bundle, compiled CSS, assets), run:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    Compiled files will be saved in the `dist/` directory.

* `dist/`: Output folder for the optimized build files (generated by Webpack).
* `index.html`: Main HTML file that includes styles and scripts.
* `webpack.config.js`: Webpack configuration file for the build process.
* `package.json`: Defines the project dependencies and start/build scripts.
* `package-lock.json`: Automatically generated by npm to record the exact versions of installed dependencies.
* `assets/`: Contains all static resources.
    * `css/`: CSS and LESS stylesheets (`style.less`).
